# YoutubePlayCrawl
If you have dowloaded a playlist from youtube but it didn't get correctly named and now you have to manualy name each video. You can use this python script that crawls the youtube playlist page and maps and renames the videos that you have saved with the proper naming.


This is just a sample(Tried  for the link 'https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGCbpkBEMiCaiu_3OL-_Bz_8'). I will try to make it unanimously for all links.
